This project was made for a 24h Hackathon where we had to create a project based on a theme (Snoop Dogs - Drop it like it's Hot) and present it at the end to our teachers and companies present at the event.

// The Idea
The idea is to have an app that allows us to pinpoint services at locations marked by the users.

// The Development
We decided to use the Google Maps API as the base of the service allowing us to mark locations and share that information between users. The service requires you to have a key to allow for registration, key that would be provided by ambassadors of the app. 

// Tech && Methodologies
Javascript, HTML, CSS, Google Maps API
